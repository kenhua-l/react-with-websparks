# React with Websparks

__Hi! I am Ken and this is React with Websparks!__
I am a Devsigner (hyphenated role between Designer and Developer) at Websparks and I mostly work on making websites beautiful and intuitively easy to use. This repo is the final product of how your react app will look like at the end of a 3 hour session with me. This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), thus I am going to leave its instructions down below. 

This course is specifically made for NUS Comp Club LifeHack 2021. Thus, some materials and sites I have set up for this session will only stay for 1 month to avoid getting charged unnecessarily :') 

Although we only have one session on ReactJS here, I am glad to help you out on any other issues you may have. At the end of the session, if you have any problems with the course material, or if you need guidance on frameworks other than React, feel free to reach out to me. I will try to help the best I can.

Reach me at my [email](kenhua.l@gmail.com) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/kenfunny#1255)!
Don't forget to leave a [feedback](https://forms.gle/rWQ3zfPAJXUHYnHJA) too!

The tools used in the project:
1. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
3. [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
4. [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

The materials are made possible by:
1. [Robin Christopher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robin-855875192), my intern :)
2. The [Reactjs.org documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

__All the best and have fun!__

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
